# API Testing with HTTParty

This homework challenged my ability to apply Ruby concepts and *OOP* to testing an API composed of the postcodes of the UK.

## What Went Well
I found most of the tests quite easy to implement, which I wasn't expecting! This has given me some much needed confidence.

## Areas for Development
At first I struggled with this homework but with a bit of help I got into the groove of writing the tests. I definitely want to be able to do the next homework in a fully independent way, since I am more than capable of doing this. I don't find HTTParty or data parsing that difficult to grasp, but I just want to have more practice writing the methods and the tests themselves.

*I want to improve my test that checks that the postcode's country is one of the four countries in the UK.*
